### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brandon and I am currently working through the Microsoft Software & Systems academy to learn programming!

I have two of my projects I developed during the academy here on my github.  One is a fun companion application for Pokemon and the other is a crafting almanac for another game called Valheim.
